INSTALLATION
------------

As of today, the proper way to install shblog is to export its $BASEDIR into
your $PATH.

$ git clone git://github.com/addikt1ve/shblog.git
$ export PATH=$HOME/shblog:$PATH

Call shblog gen to create a static/index.html file; thus you just have to do
$ ln -s $BASEDIR/static /var/www/shblog
and your blog should be available at http://localhost/shblog/
Basically, all you need to edit is BASEDIR in /shblog and conf/shblog.conf.

BASIC USAGE
-----------

You will mainly use the "post" command:

$ shblog post [post-title]

This command creates a new .shpost file in $DATADIR/year/month/day/.
Once you're finished with editing your new post, shblog will automatically do
the generation job. But if you edit your .shpost file later, you will need to
launch the HTML generation process by yourself:

$ shblog gen single <post-id>

And if you need to update your blog's index:

$ shblog gen index

I know it **can** be improved. So please:

Enjoy using shblog :-)
