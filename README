shblog is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3.

INSTALLATION
------------

$ git clone git://github.com/addikt1ve/shblog.git

* shblog (sh script) should go to /usr/bin/
* data/ should go in /var/spool/shblog/$USER/
* static/ should go in /var/cache/shblog/$USER/
* lib/ should be copied as /usr/lib/shblog
* conf/ should be copied as /etc/shblog

Call shblog gen to generate HTML files; thus you just have to create a symlink:

$ ln -s $BASEDIR/static /var/www/shblog

and your blog should be available at http://localhost/shblog/

CONFIGURATION
-------------

In order to run shblog, its configuration has to be copied to $HOME/.config.
Make sure that $HOME/.config directory already exists!

$ cp -r /etc/shblog $HOME/.config/

Basically, all you need to edit is in $CONFDIR/shblog.conf.
If you wish to use the upload function, please edit $CONFDIR/upload.conf.
Enabled modules are listed in $CONFDIR/modules.conf.

BASIC USAGE
-----------

You will mainly use the "post" command:

$ shblog post [post-title]

This command creates a new .shpost file in $DATADIR/year/month/day/.
Once you're finished with editing your new post, shblog will automatically do
the generation job. But if you edit your .shpost file later, you will need to
launch the HTML generation process by yourself:

$ shblog gen single <post-id>

And if you need to update your blog's index:

$ shblog gen index

I know it **can** be improved. So please:

Enjoy using shblog :-)
