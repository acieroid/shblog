shblog is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3.

You may use CGI with your httpd to display shblog output (index.sh).
You may also use gen.sh to create a static/index.html file; thus you just have
to $ ln -s $BASEDIR/static /var/www/shblog and your blog should be available
at http://localhost/shblog/

You should initialize $DATADIR as a darcs repository, so that you can publish
posts from any computer. See cron.example (included) to refresh the "cache".
You can use ./shblog post to create a new post; you can create it from scratch
too, respecting the usual tree:

$DATADIR
└── YYYY
    └── MM
        └── DD
            └── HHMMSS-title.shpost

Enjoy using shblog :-)
